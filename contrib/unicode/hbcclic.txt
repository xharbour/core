HBCC lib sources are intended to be used absolutely free in [x]Harbour
environment. In any case I will never be responsible for anything 
concerning it's work. I never promise I will support users but only if
I have time and energy to answer. I even do not promise I will make any
further development of it. Any feature requests may (but not must) be
implemented only if I find them of some interest and have enough time
to do this job.

Just because:
 - I'm not a professional coder for several years
 - it is a "side effect" product of my mail/news/logs handlers
 - and I do not want to support its users on obligatory basis
 - and I am in deep doubts whether its main concept is optimal
 - and "software must be free" (C) Torwalds
 - and [x]Harbour itself is free
 - and I really hate an idea of supervising any legal use of it.

Use it, modify it, criticize it - in any way you want.

WBR, Dmitry V. Korzhov (dk@april26.spb.ru)
