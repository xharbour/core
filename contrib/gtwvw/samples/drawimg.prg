   image.prg
   compile and link this file together with wutil.prg
   (use drawimg.bat to build)

   This is a sample of how to display an image file (.bmp,.gif,.jpg)
   in four ways:
   1. Image stretched to fit a region
      (all four coordinates are defined)
   2. Height is defined, width is proportional to height
      (right coordinate is passed as NIL)
   3. Width is defined, height is proportional to width
      (bottom coordinate is passed as NIL)
   4. Actual image size
      (bottom and right coordinate are NIL)

   Also shown in this sample:
   1. Image Caching
      Image is read from file only once, and then cached.
      Test: After image is displayed, delete the image file.
            Image should be still displayed with no problem,
            since gtwvw already store it in memory.
   2. Transparency
      If this option is used, topleft pixel is used as the transparent mask
      of the image.

   Remarks:
   Image drawing and wvw_paint management are performed by WUTIL.PRG.
   WUTIL.PRG is a simple "middle module" interfacing an application with
   gtwvw.
