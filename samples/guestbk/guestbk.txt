How to create and test the Harbour Guestbook

You'll find BLDGUEST.BAT, GUESTBK.PRG, GUESTBK.HTM and
GUESTBK.HTM files. To build the executable, review
GUESTBK.PRG and check the directories for locating
GUESTBK.INI and GUESTBK.HTM correctly.

With that done, build it using BLDGUEST.BAT. Put the
resulting EXE, the INI and HTM files on a script-
enabled directory and call GUESTBK.EXE via WebBrowser.

The best thing about this guestbook is its highly
configurable architecture. Please review GUESTBK.INI
for configuration options and further explanation.

That's it !!!

PS: If you don't have a WebServer, I will be pleased to
demonstrate it to you. Just contact me via ICQ, my
