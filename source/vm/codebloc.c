/* Creates the codeblock structure
 *
 * pBuffer -> the buffer with pcodes (without HB_P_PUSHBLOCK)
 * uiLocals -> number of local variables referenced in a codeblock
 * pLocalPosTable -> a table with positions on eval stack for referenced variables
 * pSymbol -> a pointer to the Symbol where block was defined
 *
 * Note: pLocalPosTable cannot be used if uiLocals is ZERO
 *
 * Another note:
 *       pLocalPosTable actually resides in the pcode before pBuffer, and we
 *       must use HB_PCODE_MKUSHORT( pLocalPosTable++ ) to handle
 *       little-endian platform-indepent pcode on big-endian machines.
 *
 * Yet another note ;-):
 *       HB_PCODE_MK*(), HB_{GET,PUT}_{LE,BE}_*() and HB_*_{FROM,TO}_LE()
 *       as many others are macros which may use more then once given
 *       parameters - you cannot use and {pre/post}{inc/dec}rementation
 *       in parameters. Changing them to function (or pseudo function) will
 *       reduce performance in many cases (but in some when poor compiler
 *       is used can give faster codes), Druzus
