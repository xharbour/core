    * source\tip\thtml.prg

      Changed code to avoid errors with VC8
      --> error C2440: 'initializing' : cannot convert from 'void *' to 'char *'

    + tests\tiptest\loadhtml.prg
    + tests\tiptest\dbtohtml.prg

    + source\tip\thtml.prg
      New HTML classes
      + THtmlDocument()
      + THtmlIterator()
      + THtmlIteratorScan()
      + THtmlIteratorRegEx()
      + THtmlNode()

      New HTML functions

    + include\thtml.ch

    * source\tip\ftpcln.prg
      + added method :pwd()

    As a short introduction:

    1) THtmlDocument() objects read/write HTML files and streams

    2) THtmlNode() objects know HTML and raise errors upon illegal HTML code

    3) THtmlNode() objects know the "+" and "-" operator for opening/closing an HTML tag

    4) THtmlNode() objects know the ":" operator for querying/creating a HTML node .OR. attribute
      (sending an unknown message results in a query of lookup tables. If that query is successful,
      a HTML node .OR. the value of an attribute is returned. Otherwise, a runtime error is raised)

      that are able to detect the type of file (or of a string) depending on 
      extension and file content. If extension is not available (if using a stream
      in Tip_FileMimeType or in Tip_MimeType) only content is used to guess the
      format, and if the file can't be open ( Tip_FileMimeType ) only the extension
      is used.
      
      If the file type can't be determined, "unknown" is returned (which is a valid
      MIME type).
