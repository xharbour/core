** Description: Implementation of the standard library function memcpy.
**             This implementation of memcpy() is ANSI-C89 compatible.
**
**             The following configuration options can be set:
**
**           LITTLE_ENDIAN   - Uses processor with little endian
**                             addressing. Default is big endian.
**
**           PRE_INC_PTRS    - Use pre increment of pointers.
**                             Default is post increment of
**                             pointers.
**
**           INDEXED_COPY    - Copying data using array indexing.
**                             Using this option, disables the
**                             PRE_INC_PTRS option.
**
**           MEMCPY_64BIT    - Compiles memcpy for 64 bit
**                             architectures
**
**
** Best Settings:
**
** Intel x86:  LITTLE_ENDIAN and INDEXED_COPY

   1. Introduction

   A co-worker of mine, Fredrik Bredberg, once made an implementation of memcpy()
   and he was very proud of the result. His implementation was faster than many
   standardized C library routines found in the embedded market. When looking at
   his code, I found several places where improvements could be made. I made an
   implementation, which was quite a lot faster than Fredrik's and this started a
   friendly competition to make the fastest portable C implementation of memcpy().
   Both our implementations got better and better and looked more alike and finally
   we had an implementation that was very fast and that beats both the native
   library routines in Windows and Linux, especially when the memory to be copied
   is not aligned on a 32 bit boundary.

   The following paragraphs contain descriptions to some of the techniques used in
   the final implementation.

   2. Mimic the CPU's Architecture

   One of the biggest advantages in the original Bredberg implementation was that
   the C code was made to imitate the instruction sets on the target processor.
   He discovered that different processors had different instructions for handling
   memory pointers. On a Motorola 68K processor the code

   *dst8++ = *src8++;

   that copies one byte from the address src8 to the address dst8 and increases
   both pointers, compiled into a single instruction:

        MOV.B (A0)+, (A2)+

   This piece of code can be put into a while loop and will copy memory from the
   address src to the address dest:

        void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t count) {
            char *dst8 = (char *)dest;
            char *src8 = (char *)src;

            while (count--) {
   *dst8++ = *src8++;
            }
            return dest;
        }

   While this is pretty good for the Motorola processor, it is not very efficient
   on a PowerPC that does not have any instructions for post incrementing pointers.
   The PowerPC uses four instructions for the same task that only required one
   instruction on the Motorola processor. However, the PowerPC has a set of
   instructions to load and store data that utilize pre increment of pointers
   which means that the following code only results in two instructions when
   compiled on the PowerPC:

   *++dst8++ = *++src8;

   In order to use this construction, the pointers have to be decreased before the
   loop begins and the final code becomes:

        void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t count) {
            char *dst8 = (char *)dest;
            char *src8 = (char *)src;

            --src8;
            --dst8;

            while (count--) {
   *++dst8 = *++src8;
            }
            return dest;
        }

   Unfortunately the ARM processor has no instructions for either pre increment
   or post increment of pointers. This means that the pointer needs to be
   incremented manually. If the example above is compiled to an ARM processor,
   the while loop would actually look something like:

        while (count--) {
            dst8[0] = src8[0];
   ++dst8;
   ++src8;
        }

   The ARM processor luckily has another feature. It can read and write to memory
   at a fixed offset from a base pointer. This resulted in a third way of
   implementing the same task:

        void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t count) {
            char *dst8 = (char *)dest;
            char *src8 = (char *)src;

            if (count & 1) {
                dst8[0] = src8[0];
                dst8 += 1;
                src8 += 1;
            }

            count /= 2;
            while (count--) {
                dst8[0] = src8[0];
                dst8[1] = src8[1];

                dst8 += 2;
                src8 += 2;
            }
            return dest;
        }

   Here the number of turns the loop has to be executed is half of what it was in
   the earlier examples and the pointers are only updated half as often.

   3. Optimizing memory accesses

   In most systems, the CPU clock runs at much higher frequency than the speed of
   the memory bus. My first improvement to the Bredberg original was to read 32
   bits at the time from the memory. It is of course possible to read larger chunks
   of data on some targets with wider data bus and wider data registers.
   The goal with the C implementation of memcpy() was to get portable code mainly
   for embedded systems. On such systems it is often expensive to use data types
   like double and some systems doesn't have a FPU (Floating Point Unit).

   By trying to read and write memory in 32 bit blocks as often as possible, the
   peed of the implementation is increased dramatically, especially when copying
   data that is not aligned on a 32-bit boundary.

   It is however quite tricky to do this. The accesses to memory need to be aligned
   on 32-bit addresses. The implementation needs two temporary variables that
   implement a 64-bit sliding window where the source data is kept temporary while
   being copied into the destination. The example below shows how this can be done
   when the destination buffer is aligned on a 32-bit address and the source buffer
   is 8 bits off the alignment:

        srcWord = *src32++;

        while (len--) {
            dstWord  = srcWord << 8;
            srcWord  = *src32++;
            dstWord |= srcWord >> 24;
   *dst32++ = dstWord;
        }

   4. Optimizing branches

   Another improvement is to make it easier for the compiler to generate code that
   utilizes the processors compare instructions in an efficient way. This means
   creating loops that terminates when a compare value is zero. The loop

        while (++i > count)

   often generates more complicated and inefficient code than

        while (count--)

   Another thing that makes the code more efficient is when the CPU's native loop
   instructions can be used. A compiler often generates better code for the loop
   above than for the following loop expression

        while (count -= 2)

   5. Conclusion

   The techniques described here makes the C implementation of memcpy() a lot
   faster and in many cases faster than commercial ones. The implementation can
   probably be improved even more, especially by using wider data types when
   available. If the target and the compiler supports 64-bit arithmetic operations
   such as the shift operator, these techniques can be used to implement a 64-bit
   version as well. I tried to find a compiler with this support for SPARC but I
   didn't find one. If 64-bit operations can be made in one instruction, the
   implementation will be faster than the native Solaris memcpy() which is probably
   written in assembly.

   Another improvement that can be to some 32-bit architectures made is that if
   both the source and the destination buffer are 64-bit aligned or have the same
   alignment, a double type can be used to speed up the copying. I tried this with
   the gcc compiler for x86 and the result was a memcpy() that was faster in almost
   all cases than the native Linux memcpy().

   6. The complete source code

   The following code contains the complete memcpy() implementation.
   The code is configured for an intel x86 target but it is easy to change
   configuration as desired.
