  Background:
  There are two definitions for each of the following functions:
     hb_xgrab    => source/compiler/harbour.c  source/vm/fm.c
     hb_xfree    => source/compiler/harbour.c  source/vm/fm.c
     hb_xrealloc => source/compiler/harbour.c  source/vm/fm.c
  These definitions may help to solve probability of name conflict.
