 *      IsLeapYr( [<dDate>] ) --> lIsLeap
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *      <dDate> is an optional date. If not supplied is defaults to the

 *      IsLeapYr() can be used to check if a given year is a leap year.
 *  $EXAMPLES$
 *      // Check if it's a leap year.
 *
 *      If IsLeapYr()
 *         ? "One extra day before you get paid this Feb!!"

 *                                      the Guile 1.4 license (the old one
 *                                      was based on an earlier Guile).
 * V 1.12   Viktor Szakats              Year changed to 2000 from 1999.
 * V 1.11   Viktor Szakats              $FILES$ added.
 * V 1.10   Viktor Szakats              $PLATFORMS$ added.
 * V 1.9    Viktor Szakats              Small format changes.
 * V 1.8    Viktor Szakats              licence -> license
 * V 1.7    Viktor Szakats              History separated from the file header
 *                                      template. Slight changes in the format
 *                                      of the header. Removed "(proposal)"
 *                                      from the top of the file. Added partial
 *                                      copyright header template.
 * V 1.6    Viktor Szakats              RCS Id section separated from

 *                                      next to each version number, because
 *                                      the RCS tracks dates, but only tracks
 *                                      CVS user names, not author names.
 * V 1.3    Viktor Szakats              Description line changed to be a
 *                                      template, too.
 * V 1.2    David G. Holm               Added HRL/HVM license exception for
 *                                      executables. Added GNU web site.
 *                                      Replaced "?" in copyright statement
 *                                      with "(list of individual authors)".
 * V 1.1    Viktor Szakats              Added templates for file and function
 *                                      headers. Committed to CVS.
 * V 1.0    Viktor Szakats              Initial version.
