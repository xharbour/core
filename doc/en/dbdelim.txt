 *  $SYNTAX$
 *      __dbDelim( <lExport>, <xcFile>, [<xcDelim>], [<aFields>],
 *      [<bFor>], [<bWhile>], [<nNext>], [<nRecord>], <lRest>  ) --> NIL
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *      <lExport> If set to .T., copies records to a delimited file.
 *      If set to .F., append records from a delimited file.

 *      delimiter (only the first character is used). or "BLANK" (not case
 *      sensitive), which eliminates the character field delimiters and
 *      sets the field separator to a single space instead of a comma.
 *      <aFields> An aray of field names to limit the processint to. If
 *      not specified, or if empty, then all fields are processed.
 *      <bFor> An optional code block containing a FOR expression that
 *      will reduce the number of records to be processed.
 *      <bWhile> An optional code block containing a WHILE expression
 *      that will reduce the number of records to be processed.
 *      <nNext> If present, but nRecord is not present, specifies to
 *      process this number of records, starting with the current record.
 *      A value of 0 means to process no records.
 *      <nRecord> If present, specifies the only record to process. A
 *      value of 0 means to process no records. Overrides nNext and lRest.
 *      <lRest> If lExport is .T., then if set to .T. and there are no
 *      nRecord, nNext, or bWhile arguments, processes all records from
 *      current to last.
 *  $RETURNS$
 *      NIL
