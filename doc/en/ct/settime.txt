 *  $FUNCNAME$
 *      WAITPERIOD()
 *  $CATEGORY$
 *      HBCT date and time functions
 *  $ONELINER$
 *      Pauses a specified time in increments of 1/100 seconds
 *  $SYNTAX$
 *      WAITPERIOD([<nDelay>]) --> lNotElapsed
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *      <nDelay>  Designates the waiting period at initialization in
 *      1/100ths of seconds.  Values from 1 to 8, 640, 000 (one day) are
 *      possible.
 *  $RETURNS$
 *      WAITPERIOD() returns .T. , if the time span designated at initialization
 *      has not elapsed.
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *      This function sets a time span for a xHarbour DO WHILE loop to run.
 *      The function must initialize prior to the loop, since you must specify
 *      the <nDelay> parameter in 1/100th seconds.  Subsequently, the function
 *      can be implemented without a parameter for additional loop conditions.
 *      It returns .T., as long as the designated time span has not yet run out.
 *
 *      Note
 *
 *      The function notes the status of the internal timer at
 *      initialization.  From that point on, the initialization should always
 *      precede the respective DO WHILE; otherwise, the time delay is
 *      incorrect.  The passing of midnight (the time resets to the 0 value)
 *      is taken into account.
 *  $EXAMPLES$
 *      Run a loop for 5 seconds:
 *
 *      WAITPERIOD(500)               // Initialization, 5 seconds
 *      DO WHILE <cond1> .AND. <cond2> .AND. WAITPERIOD()
 *        *...
 *      ENDDO
 *  $TESTS$
 *  $STATUS$
 *      Ready
 *  $COMPLIANCE$
 *      WAITPERIOD() is Clipper Tools compatible.
 *  $PLATFORMS$
 *      Windows
 *  $FILES$
 *      Source is settime.prg, library is libct.
