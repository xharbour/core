 *      CLASS
 *  $CATEGORY$
 *      OOP Command
 *  $ONELINER$
 *      Define a Class for Object Oriented Programming
 *  $SYNTAX$
 *      [CREATE] CLASS <ClassName> [ <FROM, INHERIT> <SuperClass1> [,<SuperClassN>] ]  [STATIC]
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *      <ClassName>  Name of the class to define. By tradition, Harbour
 *                   classes start with "T" to avoid collisions with user-
 *                   created classes.
 *
 *      <SuperClass1...n> The Parent class(es) to use for inheritance.
 *                   Harbour supports Multiple Inheritance.
 *
 *      STATIC       This clause causes the class function to be declared
 *                   as a static function. It will therefore not be available outside the current module.
 *
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *      CLASS creates a class from which you can create objects.
 *      The CLASS command begins the class specification, in which the DATA
 *      elements (also known as instance variables) and METHODS of the
 *      class are named. The following scoping commands may also appear.
 *      They control the default scope of DATA and METHOD commands that follow them.
 *
 *      <fixed>
 *         EXPORTED: 
 *         VISIBLE: 
 *         HIDDEN: 
 *         PROTECTED: 
 *      </fixed>
 *      The class specification ends with the END CLASS command.
 *
 *      Classes can inherit from multiple <SuperClasses>, and the chain of
 *      inheritance can extend to many levels.
 *
 *      A program uses a Class by calling the Class Constructor, usually the
 *      New() method, to create an object. That object is usually assigned
 *      to a variable, which is used to access the DATA elements and
 *      methods.
 *
 *      Harbour's OOP syntax and implementation supports Scoping (Protect, Hidden and Readonly)
 *      and Delegating, and is largely compatible with Class(y)(tm), TopClass(tm)
 *      and Visual Objects(tm).

 *      DATA
 *  $CATEGORY$
 *      OOP Command
 *  $ONELINER$
 *      Alternate syntax for VAR: instance variable for the objects.
 *  $SYNTAX$
 *      DATA <DataName1> [,<DataNameN>] [ AS <type> ] [ INIT <uValue> ]
 *      [[EXPORTED | VISIBLE] | [PROTECTED] | [HIDDEN]] [READONLY | RO]
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *      <DataName1>  Name of the DATA

 *      <type>       Optional data type specification from the following:
 *                   Character, Numeric, Date, Logical, Codeblock, Nil.

 *      <uValue>     Optional initial value when creating a new object.
 *
 *      EXPORTED     Specifies that this DATA is accessible to functions and
 *                   methods outside of the class.  VISIBLE is a synonym for EXPORTED.
 *
 *      PROTECTED    Specifies that this DATA is only accessible to functions and methods within this class and its subclasses.
 *
 *      HIDDEN       Specifies that this DATA is only accessible to the
 *                   class where it was defined, and is not inherited by the
 *                   subclasses.

 *      READONLY     Restricts assignment to the variable. If specified with
 *                   the EXPORTED clause, assignment is only permitted from the current
 *                   class and its subclasses.  If specified with the PROTECTED clause,
 *                   assignment is only permitted from the current class.
 *                   RO is a synonym for READONLY.

 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *      DATA elements can also be thought of as the "properties" of an
 *      object. They can be of any data type, including codeblock.
 *      Once an object has been created, the DATA elements are referenced
 *      with the colon (:) as in  MyObject:Heading := "Last name".
 *      Usually a class also defines methods to manipulate the DATA.
 *
 *      You can use the "AS <type>" clause to enforce that the DATA is
 *      maintained as a certain type. Otherwise it will take on the type of
 *      whatever value is first assigned to it.
 *
 *      Use the "INIT <uValue>" clause to initialize that DATA to <uValue>
 *      whenever a new object is created.
 *
 *      VAR can be a synonym for DATA, or it can use a slightly different
 *      syntax for compatibility with other dialects.

 *      CLASS TBColumn

 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *      CLASSDATA variables can also be thought of as the "properties" of an

 *      Declare a METHOD for a class in the class header

 *      METHOD <MethodName>( [<params,...>] ) INLINE <Code,...>
 *      METHOD <MethodName>( [<params,...>] ) BLOCK  <CodeBlock>

 *      METHOD <MethodName>( [<param>] )      OPERATOR <op>
 *      METHOD <MethodName>( [<params,...>] ) CLASS <ClassName>
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *      <MethodName>  Name of the method to define

 *      <params,...>  Optional parameter list
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *      Methods are "class functions" which do the work of the class.
 *      All methods must be defined in the class header between the
 *      CLASS and ENDCLASS commands.  If the body of a method is not fully
 *      defined here, the full body is written below the ENDCLASS command
 *      using this syntax:
 *
 *         METHOD <MethodName>( [<params,...>] ) CLASS <ClassName>
 *
 *      Methods can reference the current object with the keyword "Self:" or
 *      its shorthand version "::".
 *
 *      CLAUSES:
 *
 *      CONSTRUCTOR  Defines a special method Class Constructor method,
 *                   used to create objects.  This is usually the
 *                   New() method. Constructors always return the new
 *                   object.
 *
 *      INLINE       Fast and easy to code, INLINE lets you define the
 *                   code for the method immediately within the definition
 *                   of the Class. Any methods not declared INLINE or BLOCK
 *                   must be fully defined after the ENDCLASS command.
 *                   The <Code,...> following INLINE receives a parameter
 *                   of Self. If you need to receive more parameters, use
 *                   the BLOCK clause instead.
 *
 *      BLOCK        Use this clause when you want to declare fast 'inline'
 *                   methods that need parameters. The first parameter to
 *                   <CodeBlock> must be Self, as in:
 *
 *          METHOD <MethodName> BLOCK {|Self,<arg1>,<arg2>, ...,<argN>|...}
 *
 *      EXTERN       If an external function does what the method needs,
 *                   use this clause to make an optimized call to that
 *                   function directly.
 *
 *      SETGET       For calculated Data. The name of the method can be
 *                   manipulated like a Data element to Set or Get a value.
 *
 *      VIRTUAL      Methods that do nothing. Useful for Base classes where
 *                   the child class will define the method's behavior, or
 *                   when you are first creating and testing a Class.
 *
 *      OPERATOR     Operator Overloading for classes.
 *                   See example Tests/TestOp.prg for details.
 *
 *      CLASS <ClassName>
 *                   Use this syntax only for defining a full method after
 *                   the ENDCLASS command.
 *  $EXAMPLES$
        <fixed>
 *      CLASS TWindow
 *         DATA   hWnd, nOldProc

 *      <MethodName>   The method to create and call when <MessageName>
 *                     is invoked.

 *      <params,...>   Optional parameter list for the method
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *      The MESSAGE command is a seldom-used feature that lets you re-route
 *      a call to a method with a different name. This can be necessary if
 *      a method name conflicts with a public function that needs to be
 *      called from within the class methods.
 *
 *      For example, your app may have a public function called BeginPaint()
 *      that is used in painting windows. It would also be natural to have a
 *      Window class method called :BeginPaint() that the application can
 *      call. But within the class method you would not be able to call the
 *      public function because internally methods are based on static
 *      functions (which hide public functions of the same name).
 *
 *      The MESSAGE command lets you create the true method with a different
 *      name (::xBeginPaint()), yet still allow the ::BeginPaint() syntax
 *      to call ::xBeginPaint().  This is then free to call the public
 *      function BeginPaint().
