 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *<b>Language extensions:</b>   </par>
 *--------------------
 *
 ** Class generation and management.   
 *
 *        Clipper only allowed creation of objects from a few standard
 *        classes.
 *
 *        In Harbour, you can create your own classes--complete with
 *        Methods, Instance Variables, Class Variables and Inheritance.
 *        Entire applications can be designed and coded in Object Oriented
 *        style.   
 *
 ** @<FunctionName>()   </par>
 *
 *        Returns the pointer (address) to a function.   
 *
 *        The returned value is not useful to application-level programming, but
 *        is used at a low level to implement object oriented coding.
 *        (Internally, a class method is a static function and there is no
 *        symbol for it, so it is accessed via its address).   
 *
 ** Class HBGetList
 *
 *        Object oriented support for GetLists management.   
 *
 ** ProcName() support for class Method names.
 *
 *        Class Methods can be retrieved from the call stack.   
 *
 ** Memory() has new return values.
 *
 *        See hbmemory.ch   
 *
 ** Transform()  --> new function in format string
 *
 *        @0      Make a zero padded string out of the number.   
 *
 ** SToD()  --> dDate
 *
 *        New function that converts a yyyymmdd string to a Date value.   
 *
 ** Optional Compile Time STRONG TYPE declaration (and compile time TYPE
 *  MISMATCH warnings)      
 *
 *  Example: LOCAL/STATIC Var AS ...   
 *
 ** The Harbour debugger provides new interesting classes:
 *
 *  - Class TDbWindow could be the foundation for a generic multiplatform
 *
 *  - Class TForm
 *
 *  - Class TDbMenu implement both pulldown and popup menus.   
 *
 *<b>RTL enhanced functionality:</b>   </par>
 *---------------------------   
 *
 *- Directory( <cMask>, <cFlags>, <lEightDotThree> )
 *
 *  The 3rd parameter is a Harbour (optional) parameter and indicates that on
 *  those platforms that support long filenames, that you wish to receive what
 *  would be considered the dos equivalant 8.3 name.
 *  Could affect Adir() and Dir if they were modified to take advantage
 *  of it - currently, they will return long names if the os supports it.   
 *
 *- HB_DiskSpace( <nDrive>, <nType> )
 *
 *  The second parameter is a Harbour (optional) parameter and indicates the
 *  type of diskinfo being requested.  See en/diskspac.txt for info.
