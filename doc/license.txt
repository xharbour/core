 THE HARBOUR PROJECT LIBRARY LICENSE
 ===================================

 Note: This license applies to most of the files in the include directory,
       source directory, and subdirectories.

 This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)
 any later version.

 This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

 GNU General Public License for more details.

 You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
 along with this software; see the file COPYING.  If not, write to
 the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330,
 Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA (or visit the web site http://www.gnu.org/).

 As a special exception, the Harbour Project gives permission for
 additional uses of the text contained in its release of Harbour.

 The exception is that, if you link the Harbour libraries with other
 files to produce an executable, this does not by itself cause the
 resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General Public License.
 Your use of that executable is in no way restricted on account of
 linking the Harbour library code into it.

 This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why
 the executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.

 This exception applies only to the code released by the Harbour
 Project under the name Harbour.  If you copy code from other
 Harbour Project or Free Software Foundation releases into a copy of
 Harbour, as the General Public License permits, the exception does
 not apply to the code that you add in this way.  To avoid misleading
 anyone as to the status of such modified files, you must delete
 this exception notice from them.

 If you write modifications of your own for Harbour, it is your choice
 whether to permit this exception to apply to your modifications.
 If you do not wish that, delete this exception notice.

 The exception is that if you link the Harbour Runtime Library (HRL)
 and/or the Harbour Virtual Machine (HVM) with other files to produce
 an executable, this does not by itself cause the resulting executable

 THE HARBOUR PROJECT CONTRIB LICENSE
 ===================================

 There is no one single license that applies to the Harbour Project
 contrib files. Some files use the Harbour Project Compiler license.
 Some files use the Harbour Project Library license. Some files use
 the old Harbour Project Library license (and in one case, just one
 function in a file that otherwise uses the Harbour Project Library
 license uses the old license - this is the DateTime() function in
 the file  contrib\libmisc\dates2.c).  Some files may even use other
 types of free software or open source  software licenses. Some files
 have been donated to the public domain. If you use any of the contrib
 files, you need to investigate the license that applies to each file.
