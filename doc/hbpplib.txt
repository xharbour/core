Harbour run-time preprocessing library.

How to create HBPP.LIB

This file should contain preproc.c, hbpplib.b32, bldhbpp.bat,
testpre.prg, bld32exe.bat and hbpplib.txt (this file<g>).

In order to create and test this library, you should put:

- preproc.c in \HARBOUR\SOURCE\HBPP directory;
- hbpplib.b32 and bldhbpp.bat in \HARBOUR directory;
- testpre.prg and bld32exe.bat in \HARBOUR\TESTS\WORKING directory;
- hbpplib.txt in \HARBOUR\DOC directory;

Then, you need to run bldhbpp.bat to create HBPP.LIB on
\HARBOUR\LIBS\B32 directory. Note that by now the only makefile is
for compiling with Borland C compilers. I kindly ask who has other
compilers/environments to write the missing makefiles please!

To test testpre.prg you just need to go TESTS\WORKING dir and make
it using HB32 TESTPRE.
