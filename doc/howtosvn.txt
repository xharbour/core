1.1 Here's how to prepare for uploading to the SVN server
=========================================================
by Viktor Szakats

 1) Read the Harbour README.txt, monitor the development mailing list,
    consult with the developers, make contributions. This way your chances
    are high to get a R/W access to the repository.
 2) Before uploading anything you'll need Developer (R/W) status for the
    Harbour SVN server. To get this please make a request on the list,
    or contact the Harbour Administrators. Note that getting Developer
    status is not an automatic process.
 3) You'll need an SVN client for your platform.
 4) Do a complete checkout to get the fresh source tree.

1.2 Here's how to upload your changes to the SVN server
=======================================================
by Viktor Szakats

 1) Do the changes in the source, and in parallel modify ChangeLog.txt
 2) Go online (if needed)
 3) svn update
 4) Resolve all conflicts
 5) Copy the last ChangeLog.txt entry to the clipboard
 6) svn commit --editor-cmd notepad.exe --username sfuser
    Change notepad.exe to the editor of your choice and platform.
    Change "sfuser" to your sf.net username.
 7) The SVN pops up a window with the changed filenames
 8) Check if all the changed filenames are referred in the ChangeLog.txt entry,
    if not, make the corrections and start again
 9) Paste the ChangeLog.txt entry header to the SVN window, save, exit
10) SVN is now uploading,
    if there are any errors, make the corrections and start again
11) Always check if the upload session ended without errors.
12) Go offline (if needed)

alternative method:
by Ryszard Glab

 1) Do the changes in the source
 2) Run 'svn update' redirecting the output into a file
    (for example: "svn update -d >.log"
 3) Resolve all conflicts, run SVN update again (see point 2), recompile
    all sources, fix all errors
 4) Run 'svn status' redirecting the output into a file
    (for example: "svn status >.log"
 5) Copy all names of modifed, added or deleted files (files marked with
    'M', 'A' or 'D' flag) from update log into the ChangeLog.txt
 6) Write necessary comments in the ChangeLog.txt
 7) Save all your changes from ChangeLog.txt into a file
 8) Run 'svn update' again
 9) Commit changes running:
    svn commit -F file_with_saved_ChangeLog_changes --username sfuser

Important notes:

 1) *Always* add a ChangeLog.txt entry when committing to the SVN.
 2) When adding a new file to the SVN, always use lower case 8.3
    filenames (*), add a SVN ID header to the file, don't use tabs
    in the file, end the file with a newline char.
    Possibly consult other Developers about the new filename and file
    placement.
    Add the new filename to the related makefiles.
    (*) There are some exceptions: ChangeLog.*, Makefile, COPYING.txt,
        README.txt.

1.3 Here's how to format your ChangeLog.txt entries
===================================================
by Viktor Szakats

- Always add new entries to the top of the ChangeLog.txt

- Add an entry header using this format:
  YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC[-|+]hhmm Your Full Name <your_email_address>

  For example:
    2011-05-27 23:12 UTC+0100 Viktor Szakats (harbour syenar.net)

- Add a entry body which lists all filenames changed, all of
  them with full path spec. Mention the name of the changed function or
  macro. Describe what you've changed, the reasons, and other comments
  and explanations you find useful. If the change needs some related work
  to be done by someone else (documentation, makefile), make a clear note
  about this.
  Group the related changes into logical sections separated by empty lines.

  Sample:

   * dir/filenam1.txt
   + dir/filenam2.txt
   - dir/filenam3.txt
     * Change
     ! Fix
     % Optimization
     + Addition
     - Removal
     ; Comment

- Best is to use commit.hb script to add new entry:
    <harbour dir>$ hbrun bin/commit.hb
  Then add the change descriptions.

- In case of incompatible changes, add the word 'INCOMPATIBLE' to
  the text.

- Mark comments suggesting further fixes with '[TOFIX]', further
  todos as '[TODO]', and update these to '[DONE]' when implemented.

- Mark changes to merge with different branch as '[TOMERGE x.0]'.
  Changes these to '[MERGED x.0]' when merge is completed.

- Mark changes causing user-level incompatibility with '[INCOMPAT]'

- Do not use tabs and non-ASCII chars. Remove trailing spaces.

- Leave an empty line between the header and body and one after the body.

- Do not add unicode BOM to the file

- Do not use tabs

1.4 Here's how to use the SVN server in anonymous read-only mode
================================================================

Please read the following FAQ entry:

1.5 Things to do to avoid damaging the SourceForge SVN tree
===========================================================
by David G. Holm

1) Always do your Harbour development using your local SVN tree. Do not
   do your development outside your local SVN tree and then copy your
   changes into your local SVN tree to commit them, because that leads
   easily to accidentally overwriting changes made by others, because
   you didn't notice that a module that you were also working on was
   changed by someone else. By always doing Harbour development using
   your local SVN tree, changes made by others will be merged with your
   changes and you only need to recompile and retest before committing.

2) Always run 'SVN update' from the 'harbour' directory before you run
   'svn commit'. Ideally, you should redirect the output from the update
   to a file and look at the results to confirm that you are ready to do
   a commit. Any files marked M, A or D are files that you have modified
   or are adding or deleting. Confirm that you have comments for all of
   them in your ChangeLog.txt entry. If you see many modules marked P or U,
   then you need to recompile and retest before you commit your changes.

   If you see any conflicts reported in the update output, then you need
   to resolve them before committing. SVN is generally good at merging
   changes, so you probably won't see conflicts very often, but if you
   edit the ChangeLog.txt before you run 'svn update' and other changes
   have been committed by others, then ChangeLog.txt will have conflicts.
   To resolve those conflicts, simply remove the conflict markers. What
   I do to avoid conflicts to ChangeLog.txt is to record my changes in
   changes.txt and then copy them into ChangeLog.txt between the update
   and the commit.

1.6 How to add SVN ID to new files
==================================
by Maurilio Longo

Add these three lines to the top of your source file:

/*
 * $Id: howtosvn.txt 9899 2013-01-10 12:08:42Z andijahja $
 */

As soon as you commit your file, SVN ID string will be expanded
by SVN client to full length.

IMPORTANT 2: Run these commands and commit:
  svn propset svn:keywords "Author Date Id Revision" <filename>
  svn propset svn:eol-style native <filename>

IMPORTANT 3: Use operating system (or tool) specific quote
             characters instead of double quotes shown in above
             example. Some UI SVN tools may not require putting
             the value in quote at all, *nix systems require
             quoting only for space characters, etc.
