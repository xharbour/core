  + source/rtl/dbjoin.prg
    + added missing file

2005-11-06 13:00 UTC+0200 Pavel Tsarenko <tpe2@mail.ru>
  * source/rdd/dbf1.c
    + Added hb_dbfTranslateRec function. I don't want to add codedpage
      traslation functionality to GETREC/PUTREC functions because of memo
      fields presence. May be it's better to move translation GETREC/PUTREC
      and left only memo translation in GETVALUE/PUTVALUE ?
      Przemek please review

  * utils/hbmake/hbmake.prg
    * version 1.155
    ! fixed gtwvt and gtwvw libs into lib list of hbmake. Now we doesn't
      need appoint wvwgui.lib as an external lib, this is already done when
      we choose gtwvt or gtwvw as graphical lib.
    + added Pelles C as an alternative to C compiler under MS-Windows platform.
    + added "[/pc|-pc]" as parameter to activate Pelles as C compiler. 
    + hbmake can activate correspondent C compiler by extension of make file:

      ex: hbmake hello.bc -e  to activate Borland C (default)
          hbmake hello.vc -e  to activate MS-Visual C
          hbmake hello.pc -e  to activate Pelles C

  * utils/hbmake/hbmutils.prg
    * added GetPoccDir() function to get Pelles C dir.

  * utils/hbmake/hbmlang.c
    ! updated gauge functions from xharbour/contrib/hbcurl/gauge.c
      The source gauge.c could be moved to rtl lib or other core lib to
      avoid redundancies. This source is present in 4 places:
      contrib/hbcurl, source/clipsamp, tests/misc and embedded in
      utils/hbmake/hbmlang.c.

  * utils/hbmake/tmake.prg
    * clean up in the code:
      methods: Reset(), WriteMakeFileHeader(), SetMakeCommands(),
               WriteMakeFile() and WriteLibMakeFile() was removed.

     + added "DATA cMacro"


      NOTE: The makefile header now begins with "#BCC","#MSVC","#POCC" or
            "#GCC" in accordance with the respective C compiler.
            The sets BCB, BHC, MAKEDIR and HMAKEDIR was changed:

            From:

            #BCC
            VERSION=BCB.01
            !ifndef BCB
            BCB = $(MAKEDIR)
            !endif

            !ifndef BHC
            BHC = $(HMAKEDIR)
            !endif

            To:

            #BCC
            VERSION=BCB.01
            !ifndef CC_DIR
            CC_DIR = $(MAKE_DIR)
            !endif

            !ifndef HB_DIR
            HB_DIR = $(HARBOUR_DIR)
            !endif

      *** Because these changes all make files must be recreated newly ***

  wrong with strings though it may work.

  /*
     Implementation of HB_STRING_REALLOC is experimental and should be reviewd
     by the group. The auto expansion factor of doubling was only a tentative
     value. Such value may be changed to another hard coded value, use some
     R/T setting, or even be completely conditional using R/T setting.

     The above change was initiated by an observation of an xHarbour user
     that string concatenations in xHarbour is exponentially slower with larger
     strings. After above change slow down is linear, as it should be.

    * Stop using GC. Now HVM at termination calls the debugger entry
      function with HB_DBG_VMQUIT so that the debugger can run its
      cleanup routines. It is guaranteed that it is the last call of
      the debugger entry function. In hvm.c, I used code suggested by
      Przemek, no fix was necessary ;)
    ! Fixed some memory leaks.
    ! Fixed recurse debugger calls when calling a function with debug
      info from within the debugger.

2005-10-29 02:10 UTC+0200 Przemyslaw Czerpak (druzus/at/priv.onet.pl)
  * xharbour/contrib/rdd_ads/ace.h
    * disable #pragma warning( error : 4706 ) for GNUC to avoid
      warnings in MinGW build
  * xharbour/contrib/rdd_ads/ads1.c
  * xharbour/contrib/rdd_ads/adsfunc.c
  * xharbour/contrib/rdd_ads/rddads.h
    * moved declaration of public variables to header file to avoid possible
      problems with different version in each file
    + added ADS_USE_OEM_TRANSLATION macro set by default when
      ADS_REQUIRE_VERSION >= 6 && defined( HB_OS_WIN_32 )
      If someone want then can add such translation also to older ADS
      versions without accessing new ADS functions - I do not see any
      reason to limit it only to ADS_REQUIRE_VERSION >= 6
    * cleaned the code which called hb_ansioem() and hb_oemansi()
      to avoid redundant memory allocation and freeing.
    - removed hb_ansioem() and hb_oemansi() functions and added
      hb_adsOemToAnsi(), hb_adsAnsiToOem(), hb_adsOemAnsiFree()
      which are functions or dummy macros - using them make code much
      more simple then it was and faster because there is no unnecessary
      memory allocating and freeing.
    ! fixed bugs with direct modifications of string item internals by
      old hb_ansioem()/hb_oemansi() - Brian you cannot change the contents
      of string buffer returned by hb_parc[x]() or hb_itemGetCPtr() - it
      could be shared item, static area or even part of PCODE which will
      be overwritten causing GPF or later RT errors or bad application
      behavior.
    * fixed casting of ADS connection handle when return and retrive
      to/from item by adding macros to operate on it:
      HB_ADS_PARCONNECTION( n ), HB_ADS_RETCONNECTION( h ),
      HB_ADS_GETCONNECTION( p ), HB_ADS_PUTCONNECTION( p, h ),
      HB_ADS_DEFCONNECTION( v )
      Now you can chose any form for translation of ADS connection handle
      to HB_ITEM by simple modification of this macros. You can also enable/
      disable your own connection handles in one place only. When ExtSys will
      release ACE for XP64 then you will only have to change this macros
      in rdd_ads.h.

  * xharbour/include/hbcomp.h
    * changed cScope in FUNCTION and COMSYMBOL structures from char to
      HB_SYMBOLSCOPE

  * xharbour/include/hbvmpub.h

    + added HB_FS_LOCAL symbol scope

  * xharbour/include/thread.h
    * changed declarations of HB_THREAD_T for WIN32 from DWORD to unsigned
      just like in MS documentation
    * fixed order of __thread position in TLS stack declarations.
      This attribute has to be first just after static or extern if any.

  * xharbour/source/compiler/genc.c
    * use HB_FS_LOCAL symbol scope attribute instead of (PHB_DYNS) 1

  * xharbour/source/compiler/harbour.c
    * use HB_FS_LOCAL symbol scope attribute instead of (PHB_DYNS) 1

  * xharbour/source/rtl/win32ole.prg
    * cleaned code to avoid broken strict-aliasing GCC warnings

  * xharbour/source/vm/arrayshb.c
    * restored valid code of RT errors disabled to reduced number of hbtest
      warnings when in fact the problem is in hbtest which was hacked much
      earlier to hide this errors

  * xharbour/source/vm/dynsym.c
    * use HB_FS_LOCAL instead of (PHB_DYNS) 1
    * removed no longer necessary (PHB_DYNS) 1 RT checking

  * xharbour/source/vm/classes.c
  * xharbour/source/vm/errorapi.c
  * xharbour/source/vm/proc.c
    * removed no longer necessary (PHB_DYNS) 1 RT checking

  * xharbour/source/vm/hvm.c
    * removed no longer necessary (PHB_DYNS) 1 RT checking
    ! fixed HB_NOMOUSE() feature I broke in last commit
    * changed bit shift operations to work on HB_LONG type not LONG only.
      They should support the biggest served by VM integer type.
    * eliminate C stack level in HB_P_INC by reducing redundant code
      seems that using HB_ITEM was a goal itself even with the cost
      of speed in some cases ;-)
    ! fixed result substitution by error handler in HB_P_IVARREF
    ! fixed HVM stack corruption in HB_P_LOCALNEARADDINT and result
      substitution by error handler
    ! fixed HVM stack corruption in HB_P_LOCALNEARSETSTR and
      HB_P_LOCALNEARSETSTRHIDDEN with __OPASSIGN operator is overloaded
    ! fixed memory leak in HB_P_ADDINT, HB_P_SWITCHCASE, HB_P_LEFT and
      RT error with substitution
    ! fixed stack cleaning in HB_P_POPGLOBAL and __OPASSIGN operator
    ! fixed memory leak hb_vmSelectWorkarea() and RT error with substitution
    * cleaned hb_vmClassError() - really interesting construction. I guess
      created to eliminate false FM memory leak error with the cost of
      dropping unreferenced array in memory what was forcing using GC
      in all code which extensively use this RT error. Good example that
      FM statistic may force someone to create odd hack with RT bead impact
      in valid code :-(
    * cleaned in hb_vmSend() SUPER object casting. This code was modified
      and "optimized" such many times that about half of construction inside
      didn't have any sense.
    ! fixed possible GPF in hb_vmDebuggerEndProc() and .prg level debuger
      HB_VM_STACK.Return was stored in C stack HB_ITEM.
    ! fixed memory leak and error substitution hb_vmPushAliasedField()
    ! keep unused part of stack clean in hb_vmPopLocal(), hb_vmPopStatic()
      when __OPASSIGN overloaded operator is called

     Please check me. I haven't planed to make above changes and it's a side
     effect of checking for RT errors and eliminating false FM log when
     program is interrupted in error handler. I just look at some of RT
     errors calls and found the above. Sorry but I cannot left it. It has
     to be well tested. Even small typo in HVM code may cause unpredictable
     results and problems.

  * xharbour/source/vm/itemapi.c
    * removed one unused function which should be never seen by someone
      who tries to learn C looking at xHarbour source code ;-)

  * xharbour/source/vm/memvars.c
    * removed no longer necessary comment

        So you can request array of LOCAL Printers when this Arg == TRUE.
        Default is FALSE to keep previous compatibility.
    + Added 3rd item to each subarray when calling GetPrinters(.t.).
        Before each subarray was {PrinterName, PrinterPort}

     ! fixed double call to UDF for every char typed. Only particular, well defined,
       chars cause UDF to be called.
     ! Memoedit converts K_TABs into nTabSize K_SPACEs inside editbuffer, this was wrongly
       removed. Please note that we're not completely clipper compatible in K_TAB management
       because clipper memoedit does not remove all K_TABs from edit buffer when
       K_CTRL_W is called, while we do (or, better, since HBEditor is not able to treat a
       K_TAB like a string of spaces, we have to do).
     + If there is no UDF and memoedit is readonly K_UP/K_DOWN scroll memoedit content
       instead of moving cursor. This is partly compatible with clipper behaviour. To be
       made completely compatibile changes to HBEditor are needed.

      object/libraries generated after can work only with _EXACTLY_ the

    * source/hvm/* files updated to include hb_vmopt.h
    - removed #define HB_NO_DEFAULT_API_MACROS for other source files
      It's not necessary now.
      It should be safe to also remove -DHB_NO_DEFAULT_API_MACROS from
      non GNU make files which used this macro to created xharbour.dll
      Without it xharbour.dll should have noticeable faster HVM without
      any side effects

2005-10-21 16:35 UTC+0200 Maurilio Longo <maurilio.longo@libero.it>
  * source/rtl/tbrowse.prg
    + Added class TDataCache to cache rows fetched from datasource and not have to
      reload them on every movement. This makes it possible for left/right movements
      of tbrowse to use cached data which is needed when browsing big tables
      with filters leaving only few records visible.
      Try to set a filter like alias->(RecNo()) % 5000 == 0 to a few thousands records
      long .dbf file to see how much this is needed.
    ! ::DeHilite() was not working on linux (and terminals) due to a fix of mine
      ( 2004-08-06 11:30 UTC+0200 ) which was needed to be compatible with clipper
      but needs a datacache to be correctly implemented.
    ! ::colPos direct assignement now works as expected, moving hilited cell
    + ::rowPos direct assignement now works as expected, moving hilited cell (limited
      to visible rows)
    ! ::Invalidate() is used instead of ::RefreshAll()/Current() when possible, now that
      there is a datacache it makes a big difference using cached data instead of
      reloading them.
    * When K_PGDN is pressed clipper tbrowse repaints rows starting bottom-most and
      going up, this saves only a few dbSkip()s, but makes a notable difference on a heavvy
      filtered .dbf file.
    * ::aColumnsSep and ::aColorSpec moved to protected section of TBrowse, clipper tbrowse
      has not such iVars. Wvt needs to be changed to respect this.

   /* NB: I've made a lot of tests trying to be sure that I did not break anything and
          I want to thank Lorenzo Fiorini for his help in doing tests and finding out
          problems with datacache, but I've made a lot of changes so it is possible
          that something needs some fine tuning.

             This change will also force a compilation error by any

        // In addition, if lToSkip > 1 we need to iterate calls to AdsSkip(1) and

        // AdsSkip(5) may only test the filter after 5 raw skips (according to the
        // Extended Systems developers.)

      The changes applied in the above causes big databases to slow down tremendously.

      If Children present then go iterate calls to AdsSkip(1) and test the filter each time
      as Mr. Brian Hays said. If No Children... then send lToSkip as it is to ADS. We gain speed!!

  * xharbour/source/common/hbver.c
    * a small extension to GCC compiler string to inform about
      C/C++ mode

  * xharbour/source/vm/inet.c
    * added IPPROTO_IP definition - some system may not have it

  * xharbour/include/hbvm.h
  * xharbour/include/hbvmpub.h
  * xharbour/source/vm/hvm.c
    + added hb_vmAtInit()/hb_vmAtExit(). This function allow to register
      C functions which will be called just before (/after) .prg INIT
      (/EXIT) procedures
    - removed hb_vmDoInitRdd() function

  * xharbour/include/hbapirdd.h
  * xharbour/source/rdd/dbcmd.c
    * static hb_rddRegister() function changed to public

  * xharbour/include/hbextern.ch
    * changed RDD initialization code in all core RDDs.
      As a side effect of this modification we do not longer need
      internal RDD linker references with underscore at beginning.
      As I can see on news group many user still use them. Mostly
         REQUEST _ADS
      I would like to hear an opinion if I should add such references
      for backward compatibility or simply leave it as is to force
      .prg code updating
      BTW. ADS does not need any additional initialization code.
         REQUEST ADS
      is all what is necessary to have:
         ADS, ADT, ADSCDX and ADSNTX RDDs ready to work
      If programmer does not use VIA clause then only should set
      rddSetDefault() to proper AD* RDD.
      Non GNU make files has to be updated. I would like to ask Windows
      developers to do that.

2005-10-03 12:08 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <Ron in xHarbour.com>
  * xdiff.txt
    + Added note about Operator Overloading for Native Types
    + Added ARRAY ELEMENT BYREF entry

2005-10-04 00:10 UTC+0700 Budyanto Dj. <budyanto@centrin.net.id>
  * xharbour/source/rtl/gtwvt/gtwvt.c

2005-10-02 20:47 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <Ron in xHarbour.com>

  * xharbour/source/rdd/dbffpt/dbffpt1.c
    * small modification for compilation without LONGLONG support

  * xharbour/source/rtl/gtwvt/gtwvt.c
    ! fixed call back calls to use hb_vmPushState()/hb_vmPopState()
      Still codeblock holding has to be fixed.

  * xharbour/source/vm/hvm.c
    ! fixed typos in HB_TRACE debug messages after copy and past
    ! added hb_stackPush()/hb_stackDec() to hb_vmPushState()/
      hb_vmPopState() to safe currently process stack top item.
      Ron we cleaned code with POP operation but in fact the same
      may happen with PUSH when we add sth like filed references
      you asked me - instead of fighting with this we should
      always think that hb_stackTopItem() state is undefined and
      properly save/restore them.

2005-10-01 21:30 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <Ron in xHarbour.com>
  * source/vm/hvm.c
  * source/vm/estack.c
    ! Fixed GPF trap when decreasing stack pPos *before* respective hb_itemClear() was called.
      if hb_itemClrear() activated a Destructor, which then was PUSHing anything onto the stack,
      the push operation would overwrite the originating object.

2005-10-01 17:50 UTC-0300 Luiz Rafael Culik<luiz at xharbour.com.br>
  * source/rtl/ttopbar.prg
    ! fixed bug on insitem method. The  column pos of moved menu

2005-10-01 13:08 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <Ron in xHarbour.com>
  * include/hbexprb.c
    * Reset of asList.bByRef in code setting HB_ET_ARRAYAT without calling hb_compExprNewArrayAt()

2005-10-01 01:43 UTC+0200 Przemyslaw Czerpak (druzus/at/priv.onet.pl)
  * xharbour/include/inkey.ch
    * changed K_MAXMOUSE to 1016 - As I understand it should point to
      maximum inkey() mouse event which is K_NCMOUSEMOVE now

  * xharbour/include/hbapigt.h
  * xharbour/source/rtl/inkey.c
  * xharbour/source/rtl/set.c
    * rewritten inkey functions to fix some differences between Clipper
      It's now shorter more readable and should better play with
      inkey poll checking
    * hb_inkeyReset( BOOL fAllocate ) changed to hb_inkeyReset( void )
    ! fixed EVENTMASK checking - now keys can be filltered properly
      Filtering in low level GT drivers is wrong because hb_gt_ReadKey()
      can be called asynchronously to user INKEY() call and use differ
      mask. I hope this will make GTCRS and GTXWC users happy because
      I didn't want to implement wrong by definition actions in these
      GTs.

  * xharbour/source/vm/asort.c
    * minor modification

  * xharbour/source/vm/itemapi.c
    ! fixed bug reported on harbour-users group in comparison
      empty strings with SET EXACT ON

  * xharbour/include/hbvm.h
  * xharbour/source/vm/hvm.c
    + added hb_vmPushState()/hb_vmPopState() functions - to save/restore
      VM state - now only hb_stack.Return is saved but maybe sth else
      in the future so please do not copy these functions body to your
      code but just simply call it.
    * moved code with hb_stack.Return item saving into background
      functions which execute background task - it eliminate some
      unnecessary item coping when bkgtask is not executed and
      allow to execute hb_backgroundRun() without additional code
      to save/restore VM state

  * xharbour/source/vm/classes.c
    * use hb_vmPushState()/hb_vmPopState() functions - to save/restore
      VM state in destructor call

  * xharbour/source/vm/eval.c
    * use hb_vmPushState()/hb_vmPopState() functions - to save/restore
      VM state in hb_itemDo(), hb_itemDoC() and hb_itemDoCRef() functions
    + added hb_execFromArray() to hb_itemDo() functions when first
      parameter is HB_IT_ARRAY and support for execution with HB_SYMBOL
      given as pointer - now hb_itemDo() can execute in practice any
      type of items so can be used in any code

  * xharbour/source/rtl/bkgtsks.c
  * xharbour/source/rtl/idle.c
    ! save/and restore VM stack before executing user code by using
      hb_itemDo() function.

  * xharbour/source/rtl/gtapi.c
  * xharbour/source/rtl/hbserv.c
    * keep blocks and arrays in hb_itemNew() envelope instead of
      using hb_gcLock()/hb_gcUnlock() combination which is not
      save for shared items - hb_gcUnlock() unlocks all instances.

  * xharbour/source/rtl/empty.c
    - removed unnecessary ~HB_IT_BYREF

  * xharbour/source/rtl/filestat.c
    * use extended API instead of direct item operations

  * xharbour/source/rtl/hbcomprs.c
  * xharbour/source/rtl/hbcrc32.c

  * xharbour/source/vm/hbi18n.c
  * xharbour/source/vm/inet.c
  * xharbour/source/vm/thread.c
    ! fixes - writing to shared sting item buffers, GPFs,
      some buffer overflow, wrong uses of AdoptRaw, etc.
      see CVS diff for more info - I have not enough energy to
      comment it - it's nearly 2:00 A.M and I have to return
      to some of my business jobs and go to bed.
      Now RPC test work when xharbour is compiled
      without HB_UNSHARE_REFERENCES.

2005-09-30 10:38 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai (gc/at/niccolai.ws)
  * source/vm/inet.c
    + Added a fuorth parameter to the INETDGRAMBIND function to
      set the multicast address group. If given, the fuorth parameter
      must be a string in quad dot format, and will mask the socket
      so to receive multicasts only from a certain address range.

     + Added Xbase++ compatability:
       METHOD <!ClassName!>:<MethodName> => METHOD <MethodName> CLASS <ClassName>

2005-09-27 23:10 UTC-0100 Ath <Ath1 at sourceforge.net>
  * source/rtl/win32prn.prg
    * added nAlign parameter to methods TextOut, TextOutAt, TextAtFont
      possible alignments are 0 = left, 1 = right, 2 = centered (these
      should probably be changed to constants)
    + added methods SetDuplexType() (but doesn't seem to work right yet)
      and SetPrintQuality(), calling without parameter returns current value
    * modified changing of Paperbin, Duplextype, Papersize, Orientation and
      Printquality to happen during method StartPage()
    * added extra parameters & handling to SetDocumentProperties and made
      it callable during printing

  * xharbour/include/hbrddfpt.h

    + added support for SIX3 "V" fileds. It's a variable field in which
      data is stored partialy in DBF and MEMO file. In "V" fields
      strings, number, dates, logicals, arrays and nil items can be stored.
      The size of "V" field can be: 3 {"V", 3, 0} and in such case it's
      SIX3 packed date, 4 {"V", 4, 0} for 32-bit signed integer (the same as
      {"I", 4, 0}) and >= 6 for variable weak typed field for any data type.
      When "V" field size is greater then 6 then string items are partially
      stored in "V" field and rest if necessary in memo. So when you create
      {"V", 16, 0} field strings shorter then 15 bytes will be stored only
      in DBF file and when they are longer first 10 bytes will be in DBF
      and rest in MEMO file. The maximum string size in "V" field is 64'000
      bytes (note that is a little bit less then 2^16=64KB). DOUBLE items
      are stored in DBF when size >= 13 (SIX bug reproduced for compatibility
      should be >=12) integer numbers, dates, logicals, nil are always stored
      in DBF, arrays are always stored in MEMO.
      When V3 or V4 is used only the memo type file is not necessary.
      This field works exactly like in SIX3 and partially in ADS and
      can be used with any MEMO types (DBT, FPT, SMT)

  * xharbour/source/rdd/dbf1.c
    + added support for SIX3 "V" (weakly typed) fileds

      initialization *_GETFUNCTABLE() is enough but now I needed
      a function which can be inherited between different RDDs.
      In DBF* RDDs you may see how it is used for private RDD data
      stored in RDDNODE to keep some setting independently for each
      RDD. With a small modification it can be changed to keep such
      setting for each thread.

       * unshared before pushing on VM stack if they are passed by reference.
       * It's unnecessary to have it as long as you are not using buggy 3-rd party
       * C code which writes directly to string buffer of items passed by reference
       * without checking if the buffer is shared or static.
       * Any 3-rd party code should always use xHarbour API function to store
       * values in parameters passed by reference. But if someone doesn't want
       * to do that and agree to update his code after modification in our VM
       * which we can make at any time then he _must_ to make at least the
       * following operation before writing to string buffer:
       *    pItem = hb_intemUnShare( pItem );
       *
       * In valid code this macro cause only slowness so it's disabled by default.

    ! refix error messages I fixed in the past. Guys I do not have
      time to check each commit. The hbtest was wrongly updated to
      hide xHarbour bugs instead of cleaning them. I fixed some bugs
      in error messages in our VM and hbtest begin to report it as
      an error. But it does not mean that the fixes should be removed
      to reduce number of errors reported by badly hacked version of
      hbtest. In the past due to one hack I lost few trying to restore
      original Clipper logic in VAL() when the problem was cause that
      hbtest was hacked to not show bad results from old VAL() code.
      I found it when I compiled hbtest by Clipper.
      Please _only_ things which interacts with xHarbour extensions
      or Clipper bugs can be changed in hbtest but _never_ hbtest
      should be modified to hide bugs. Now it will show more errors
      then before my commit but the results are Clipper compatible
      and very important in many programs which needs real arguments
      passed to error handler.

   Now DBFDBT RDD is no longer necessary and DBFFPT should work with
   any memo files: DBT, FPT and SMT. Please test it.
   On open memo type should be recognized automatically.
   For newly created file type of MEMO can by set by:
      rddInfo( RDDI_MEMOTYPE, DB_MEMO_DBT [, <cRdd> ] )
      rddInfo( RDDI_MEMOTYPE, DB_MEMO_FPT [, <cRdd> ] )
      rddInfo( RDDI_MEMOTYPE, DB_MEMO_SMT [, <cRdd> ] )
   For FPT memo files also subversion can be set with:
      rddInfo( RDDI_MEMOVERSION, DB_MEMOEXT_FLEX [, <cRdd> ] )
      rddInfo( RDDI_MEMOVERSION, DB_MEMOEXT_SIX [, <cRdd> ] )
   Default memotype in DBFCDX is FPT(FLEX) and in DBFNTX DBT.
   DBFFPT is noe requested by default in RDDSYS() instead of
   DBFDBT which is no longer necessary.
   Please test if everything is working OK.

      need to set table type.
    + synchronize SET_DECIMALS with ADS
    + added support for relations between ADS and non ADS workareas
      and ADS only relations which cannot be resolved by ADS
    ! fixed index key conversion in ordscope() and ordkeyval()
    + added support for ordRelKeyPos() (common RDD version of
      AdsGetRelKeyPos()/AdsSetRelKeyPos()) and tuned the value calculated
      for tables without indexes
    ! fixed BOF/EOF/FOUND flag updating in child areas
    * changed some internal logic basing on information about pending
      relations and simplified ADS BOF updating
    ! fixed SEEK LAST to work like in Clipper
      TODO: the found flag should be updated to respect pending movement
      forced by active filter on client side - it's still wrong.
    * changed SELF_LOCK()/SELF_RAWLOCK() to use ACE API directly (basing
      on documented behavior). It also resolve the problems with removing
      implicit locks which are not reported by AdsGetNumLocks() and were
      not unlocked.
    + added explicit locking inside APPEND() operation - it resolve the
      problem with automatic removing locks on appended records after
      any record movement or updating by ACE library but can introduce
      race condition - it should be consulted with ACE authors if it does.
    + added some missing checking for lock (when bTestRecLocks set) in some
      operation like DELETE()/RECALL()
    - removed SELF_SKIPRAW(), SELF_ADDFILED(), SELF_FIELDEXTENT(),
      SELF_CLEARSCOPE() methods
    + added SELF_SKIPFILTER(), SELF_GETREC() and SELF_PUTREC() methods
    + added methods for relations

    + implement DBDROP(), DBEXISTS() with xHarbour file API - it should be
      enough for most of installation but we should also have alternate
      implementation with ACE API for remote file access when the resources
      are not mapped to client computer
    * read/write date values in Julian represenation if possible - this is
      our internal representation so we reduce unnecessary conversions for
      binary types and don't have to worry about _SET_DATEFORMAT setting
    ! SELF_GETVARLEN() now returns the real memo item length
    + added hb_rddGetADSWorkAreaPointer() to use instead of
      hb_rddGetCurrentWorkAreaPointer() in all ADS*() functions. The
      hb_rddGetADSWorkAreaPointer() returns NULL for non ADS* RDDs avoiding
      possible memory corruption in xHarbour or ACE area when bad handles
      or other AREA members were extracted/set
    + added some RDDI_* actions in SELF_RDDINFO()
    - removed unused members from ADS AREA

  * xharbour/include/Makefile

  * xharbour/include/hbrdddbf.h
  * xharbour/source/rdd/dbf1.c
    + added SELF_PACKREC() for compatibility with Clipper and easier
      memopack implementation

  * xharbour/source/compiler/genc.c
    ! fixed generating symbol table when static function has the same name
      as memvar

  * xharbour/source/rdd/dbcmd.c
    + added ORDRELKEYPOS() - common for all RDDs functions which supports
      DBOI_RELKEYPOS which works like AdsGetRelKeyPos()/AdsSetRelKeyPos()
      in ADS RDD. ORDRELKEYPOS( [<nGoToPos>] ) -> <nCurrPos> | NIL
      is much less expensive then ordKeyNo()/ordKeyGoTo() combination
      and should be used to implement vertical scope instead of these
      functions.
        ordRelKeyPos() called without parameters returns current position
   in index (table) file in the range 0.0 to 1.0
   ordRelKeyPos( <nPos> ) sets new position in index (table) file.
   <nPos> should be in range 0.0 to 1.0

  * xharbour/source/rdd/workarea.c
    ! fixed typo in HB_TRACE message

  * xharbour/source/rdd/dbfcdx/dbfcdx1.c
    + added support for DBOI_RELKEYPOS - ORDRELKEYPOS() returns in DBFCDX
      exactly the same results as in ADSCDX when the same index file is
      used also when scopes are used. It's unintentional side effect of
      the simplest method I used for calculation.
    * modified to use xHarbour RegEx API not the POSIX one

  * xharbour/source/rdd/dbfntx/dbfntx1.c
    + added support for DBOI_RELKEYPOS - ORDRELKEYPOS() returns in DBFNTX
      differ results then in ADSNTX. In ADS AdsGetRelKeyPos() doesn't give
      valid results IMHO the same algorithm were used as for CDX format
      which doesn't respect keys in interior nodes which are significant
      in NTX format and the fact that the number of keys can be differ then
      number of subpages - the effect is that it reach 1.0 much faster then
      it should (we are not at EOF) and AdsSetRelKeyPos() cannot set position
      to records which are not at the lowest level but chose the nearest
      one.
    * modified to use xHarbour RegEx API not the POSIX one

  * xharbour/source/rtl/direct.c
  * xharbour/source/rtl/strmatch.c
  * xharbour/source/vm/memvars.c
    * modified to use xHarbour RegEx API not the POSIX one

  * xharbour/source/vm/hvm.c
    - removed unused label

  * xharbour/source/rtl/regex.c
    + added basic xHarbour RegEx functions
   BOOL hb_regexCompile( PHB_REGEX pRegEx, const char *szRegEx,
              int iCFlags, int iEFlags );
   BOOL hb_regexGet( PHB_REGEX pRegEx, PHB_ITEM pRegExItm,
           int iCFlags, int iEFlags );
   void hb_regexFree( PHB_REGEX pRegEx );
   BOOL hb_regexMatch( PHB_REGEX pRegEx, const char *szString,
             BOOL fFull );
      This is very basic set of function which allow to eliminate all
      direct regex_t access in xHarbour core code. I will work on it
      in the future adding missing functionality and eliminating POISX
      meta layer.

  * xharbour/source/rtl/Makefile

    * [Hopefully] Completed support for operator overloading, including native types.

  /* NOTE: Operator Overloading
           --------------------

    1. When an operator has 2 arguments only the the LEFT side may overload the operation.

    2. NATIVE COMPATABILITY of operands PRECEDEs Operator Overloading declarations.
       This means that when the operation can be performed withOUT an error, overloading
       is NOT intended to take place, and will be ignored.

2005-08-23 12:40 UTC+0200 Przemyslaw Czerpak (druzus/at/priv.onet.pl)
  * xharbour/include/hbapirdd.h
    * changed {SELF|SUPER}_RECNO( AREAP, PHB_ITEM ) to
      {SELF|SUPER}_RECNO( AREAP, ULONG *)
    + added {SELF|SUPER}_RECID( AREAP, PHB_ITEM )
    + added {SELF|SUPER}_LOCATE( AREAP, BOOL fContinue ) for
      LOCATE/CONTINUE implementation on RDD level - it allows to
      speedup these operation by RDD and resolve the problem with
      external FOUND flag update
    * changed {SELF|SUPER}_UNLOCK( AREAP, ULONG ) to
      {SELF|SUPER}_UNLOCK( AREAP, PHB_ITEM ) - CL5.3 compatible.
      It was the last functions when record number was used directly.
      Now we can create full functional RDD with non numeric record IDs
    + added fBackword and fOptimized fields to DBSCOPEINFO for RDDs
      which may want to mark optimization status
    + added fOptimized to DBFILTERINFO (as above)
    + added isOptimized to DBRELINFO for RDDs which may want to mark
      that relation is optimized on server side. It greatly simplify
      relation implementation which can be resolved on both server and
      xHarbour side and be set between differ RDD work areas.
    + added PHB_ITEM abBlock to DBEVALINFO for RDD which may want to
      pass given codeblock as string to server and evaluate it on
      server side


  * xharbour/include/classes.h
    * small casting fixes for pedantic C++ compilers

  * xharbour/include/dbinfo.ch
    + added DBOI_BAGORDER (number of first order in a bag) for some
      SIX3 sx_*() functions emulation.
    + added DBOI_ISREINDEX, DBOI_I_BAGNAME, DBOI_I_TAGNAME (also SIX3)

    * __DBLOCATE() and __DBCONTINUE() now use SELF_LOCATE() method
      (in SELF_SETLOCATE() now also other DBSCOPEINFO fields are set)
    * DBORDERINF() now also to pass ordbag parameter as number - necessary
      for SIX3 emulation in some functions.

  * xharbour/source/rdd/workarea.c
    * updated for RDD modifications
    + added default WA LOCATE() method
    ! fixed dangerous code (possible memory corruption on reentrance)
      in CLEARREL() method

2005-08-23 16:00 UTC+1200 Peter Rees <peter(AT)rees.co.nz>

    ! METHOD Box(), altered to also support Rounded Rectangles

2005-08-21 23:59 UTC-0300 Eduardo Fernandes <modalsist@yahoo.com.br>
  * source/rtl/tbrowse.prg
    + created method DefColorToDisp( oCol:DefColor ) do return default array
      of indexes if any index is out of scope. Clipper compatibility.
    * changed method named DrawARow() to DrawRow() and method named AColInfo()
      to ColInfoArray() for better knowledge. This last was confused with
      ::aColsInfo data.
    * changed defines named o_??? for better management.
      All these changes are made after bug detected when I run tbdemo.prg
      located in clipper\source. The previous version of tbrowse generate
      a run time error if colorblock is called in column that data type is
      not character. The other bug is related to defcolor of columns when
      number of records is smaller than rows.

2005-08-16 21:35 UTC+0200 Lorenzo Fiorini <lorenzo_fiorini/at/teamwork.it>
  * xharbour/include/gtinfo.ch
    * added GTI_XCURSORCOLOR1, GTI_XCURSORCOLOR2, GTI_XCURSORBLINKRATE
    * Under gtxwc cursor is a "colored" character, these settings help to
    * make it more visible.
  * xharbour/source/rtl/gtxwc.c
    * moved cursor blinking code to hb_xvt_gtProcessMessages
    * added logic to control cursor color and blink rate
