        box.ch, color.ch, rdd.api.

  * source/rtl/copyfile.c
   - add run time error

19990623-23:25 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  * source/rtl/console.c
    - The non-GT API version of DISPBOX() was creating boxes that
      were one column and one row to small.

19990623-23:00 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  * source/rtl/copyfile.c
    - Renamed _fsCopy to hb_fsCopy(), in case we decide to make
      it available to other internal Harbour functions later.
  * source/rtl/files.c
    - Solved the apparent read only problem with hb_fsCreate().
      The problem turned out to be that errno is set to an error
      value if open() has to create the file instead of opening
      and truncating. And because hb_fsCreate() wasn't checking
      the return value before saving errno for hb_fsError(), an
      error would be indicated if the file had to be created.
      But now test/working/testcopy works even when newprog.prg
      (the destination for the COPY TO command) doesn't exist.

19990623-22:05 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>

   New compiler: Watcom C/C++ 10.0
 * changed rules for DJGPP - the Makefile can be used now to
   create harbour with DJGPP. The makedos.env and makefile.dos
   are obsolete now.
 * cleared the use of '\' and '/' in make rules for DOS environment
 * the make looks now for COMSPEC variable to locate the command.com
   in DOS environment
 * changed the rule for creating DJGPP library (archive) to use
   script file instead of command line - there is a limit of 128
   characters that can be placed into command line in DOS

+ include/hbpp.h
 + new file with definition shared by the preprocessor and  harbour.y
   (needed to match the declaration of AddDefine function)

19990619-00:52 Ryszard Glab <rglab@imid.med.pl>

* config/linux/gcc.cf
 * added default gcc library libm
 * added location of libm library (I have assumed /usr/lib)

* Harbour compiles fine on Linux now. However there is still some
  suspicious code in source/rtl/dir.c and source/rtl/files.c files.
  The runner.c is unsupported since it generates DOS specific code.

19990617-20:49 PST Ron Pinkas <Ron@Profit-Master.com>
  * compiler.h
    added member cType to struct VAR

        * source/hbpp/Makefile:
        Now the hbpp preprocessor is compiled before the compiler, and it

        Got rid of the RCS Log keyword on several files; this keyword
        should never be placed in a source file.
        Made sure all *.h files have a proper include guard. If the file
        name is foo.h, the include guard is called FOO_H_, without a
        leading underscore, to comply with ANSI rules.

      librarian can't distinguish between HARBOUR HB_SECONDS(void)
      and double hb_seconds(void)

    - convert_create_flags no longer returns a value, so declare as void
  * source/rtl/set.c
    - Logical SET values can now use "ON" for .T. and "OFF" for .F.

        When the compiler sees a function called FOO, it generates a call
        to HB_FOO. This meant updating the code generation (with the help
        of Eddie Runia) and updating all HARBOUR functions to prepend an
        HB_ to each of them. I also made sure all of them where declared
        in uppercase and had the signature HARBOUR HB_FOO(void).
        I may have missed something. In particular, test testhbf.prg does
        not work, but I wanted to commit this change anyway.

        could for running the GNU-make build system under plain
        COMMAND.COM (DOS and Win95), not only under bash.

  * makefile.icc
    - Added some missing source files
  * source/rtl/files.c
    - Put back '#include <direct.h>' for __WATCOM__, '#include <dir.h>'
      for __BORLANDC__, and '#include <direct.h>' for __IBMCPP__, after
      removing them earlier while removing '#include <dirent.h>', which
      isn't needed, because the DIRECTORY() function is in a separate
      source file. The reason that I thought it was safe to remove them
      was that I *thought* that I had recompiled with IBMCPP after I
      recompiled with DJGPP, but it turned out I hadn't. I'm hoping that
      I caught it before anybody extracted the bad version from CVS.

  * include/extend.h
    - Moved "#include <limits.h>" to include/types.h
    - Removed "#define FILE" and "#undef FILE", which are no longer
      needed, because HARBOUR FILE() was renamed to HARBOUR HB_FILE()
      some time ago.
  * include/types.h
    - Moved "#include <limits.h>" from include/extend.h in order to
      avoid having to require that extend.h be included before set.h
  * source/rtl/dates.c
    - HARBOUR SECONDS() and support module hb_seconds() courtesy of
      Jose Lalin <dezac@corevia.com>. I removed the use of clock()
      from hb_time(), because clock() returns the number of clock
      ticks since the program started, which has no relationship to
      when the seconds of the real time clock roll over. This means
      that SECONDS() will always return whole seconds instead of
      seconds and hundredths. I also provided an alternate hb_seconds
      implementation for DOS platforms using gettime() instead of
      time() and localtime(), because gettime() includes 1/100ths.
  * source/rtl/files.c
    - Don't "#include <mingw32/share.h>" if compiling with DJGPP.
  + tests/working/seconds.prg
    - New test program for SECONDS().

19990603-14:00 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  * makefile.dos
    - Even with the -y in the source/compiler/makefile.dos, when I
      used builddos, which uses makefile.dos, instead of a temporary
      replacement batch file that I used before I figured out why I
      was getting bad command errors when running builddos (it turned
      out that I needed to add the DJGPP\bin directory to the path in
      C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\AUTOEXEC.NT), it moved y_tab.c to harbour.c!
      So I converted everything in makefile.dos from upper case to
      lower case and it stopped doing that. So i also added the missing
      source/tools directory, so that everything gets build.
  * source/compiler/harbour.l
    - Changed yylval.string = ')'; to yylval.string = strdup( ")" );
    - Changed yylval.string = ']'; to yylval.string = strdup( "]" );

  * source/rtl/dates.c
    - localtime() returns tm_year with 1900 already subtracted from it,
      so it is necessary to add 1900 back when formatting the date.

19990603-18:30 CET Eddie Runia
  * source/rtl/classes.c; source/rtl/tclass.prg; source/rtl/arrays.c

    - bison needs -y option so that it won't replace harbour.c with y_tab.c
      when building Harbour with DJGPP
  * source/rtl/console.c
    - Moved MAXROW() and MAXCOL() from gtapi.c and added #ifdef USE_GTAPI
      in each. The #else condition defines the screen as 24x80 (23, 79)
  * source/rtl/gtapi.c
    - Moved MAXROW() and MAXCOL() to console.c in order to not include the
      GT API when it isn't wanted (such as when building with DJGPP)

19990602-20:45 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  * source/rtl/environ.c

      (both 5.2e and 5.3b), but Harbour outputs NIL and NIL (as
      tested with Harbour built using Borland C++ 3.1 using the
      build31.bat and makefile.b31 files)

19990602-22:10 CET Eddie Runia

    - OS/2 requires that stdout and stderr be flushed in order to stay
      synchronized with the GT API
  * source/rtl/gt/gtos2.c
     - The gtPuts function was using strlen() on the text buffer instead
       of using the text length parameter

19990602-14:50 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>

  * source/rtl/console.c
    - Cleaned up synchronization between GT API and dev_row, dev_col
  * source/rtl/gtapi.c
    - Initialize starting row and column to 0 instead of 1
    - _gtMaxCol() and _gtMaxRow() are 0-based in Clipper, so subtract 1
      from the device width and height
    - Removed call to strlen() in _gtSave(), because Clipper does not appear
      to require the screen buffer to be initialized, just allocated
    - Changed _gtWrite() to deal with writing multiple rows of text
    - Wrote _gtScroll(), which is needed by _gtWritePos() and _gtWrite().

19990601-21:35 CET Eddie Runia

        * source/rtl/dates.c:
        Nasty bug: using '&' instead of '&&'.

        * config/header.cf:
        * include/Makefile:
        * Makefile:
        Added rules to deal with include files (they are just installed
        into INC_DIR). Now the top level Makefile traverses include before
        source.

        * config/win32/gcc.cf:
        * config/win32/msvc.cf:
        * config/win32/global.cf:
        The include directory is now given by INC_DIR.

        * config/win32/rules.cf:
        Harbour now uses -I to find include files.

        * include/hbsetup.h:
        Moved OS_PATH_DELIMITER back to harbour.y, as PATH_DELIMITER; it
        is now a string that contains "/\\".

        * source/compiler/harbour.y:
        Deal with '/' as path separator ('\\' still works).
        Make sure -q is really quiet.

        * source/rtl/Makefile:
        * source/tools/Makefile:
        Used tabs instead of spaces.

        * source/rtl/gtapi.c:
        * source/tools/io.c:
        Made sure these two compile in non-DOS platforms (don't do much
        though).

        * source/vm/hvm.c:
        Fixed a warning about using %i instead of %li.

    - hb_itemPutND() now sets wLength to 20 if the value is over 10 digits.
  * source/rtl/math.c
    - Restored HARBOUR INT() back to use _retnl( _parnd( 1 ) ), because the
      problem was not in the Borland C++ 3.1 compiler, but in the hb_outstd()
      case for IT_LONG in console.c (see 19990518-17:30 EDT David G. Holm for
      the incorrect correction and 19990519-21:40 EST David G. Holm for the
      fix to hb_outstd() in console.c).

      largest tables are split into a third source file.
  * source/rtl/console.c
    - Corrected display of IT_LONG to use value.lNumber instead of iNumber.
    - Corrected display of IT_DOUBLE to use wLength as integer size, so that
      when printing decimals the total display size is wLength + wDec + 1.
  * source/rtl/extend.c

  * makefile.b31
    - Put all common BCC options in c_opt macro to make it easy to switch to
      C++ by simply adding -P to c_opt and changing -P- on fixflex line to -P+

    - added support for INCLUDE environment variable
    - corrected looking for unmatched ENDIF/ELSE//ELSEIF
    - added '-t' option = alternative initialization of symbol table
    When this option is used then the Harbour generates C code for a function
    <modulename>__InitSymbols that have to be called in order to properly
    initialize the global symbol table. You should use this option if you
    want to generate the C code output and your C compiler doesn't allow
    to call any function before the 'main'.

* surce/vm/initsymb.c
    - added new file that registers a symbols table with runtime support
    functions. This file can be edited to add calls for application specific
    functions that registers local symbols tables used in application modules.
    The Harbour compiler can create <modulename>__InitSymbols functions
    when you use '-t' option.

* source/vm/hvm.c

      value is truncated, wLength is set to 10, and wDec is set to 0.
  * tests/working/dates.prg
    - Removed trailing spaces in strings in OUTSDT calls with multiple items,
      because OUTSTD provides a leading space for all items but the first.
  * tests/working/mathtest.prg

        - corrected syntax check for:  case->  case+=   case-=
        - DO/WHILE/CASE/WITH is now 100% compatible with Clipper
        - there is still problem with comments that ends with **/
        (exactly two asterix and slash)

    * tests/working/keywords.prg
        - added code to test DO/WHILE/CASE/WITH

19900509-23:30 Eddie Runia

19990509-19:30 Eddie Runia
   * makefile.b16, makefile.b32
     debug.obj added

19990509-18:10 Eddie Runia

19990509-18:00 CET Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>

   * source/rtl/strings.c:
     hb_At() -> hb_strAt()
   * source/rtl/*.c, source/include/extend.h
     hb_julian2greg() -> hb_dateDecode()
     hb_greg2julian() -> hb_dateEncode()

19990508-20:57 Eddie Runia
   * source/rtl/arrays.c:
     Fixed unreleased memory block in aEval.

19990508-15:24 CET Victor Szel <info@szelvesz.hu>

   * source/rtl/strings.c:
     Fixed warning in PADR(), PADL(), PADC() (David G. Holm)

19990507-23:45 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  This update makes Harbour compatible with the IBM C++ compiler.
  * include/init.h
    - Added test for IBM C++ compiler to Microsoft C #if block
  * include/types.h
    - Added #ifdef block for IBM C++ compiler to set #define for
      HARBOUR as simply void and also to set up a new #define
      for EXTERNAL_LINKAGE (as _LNK_CONV) in order for the
      IBM C++ compiler to compile harbour.y.
  * source/compiler/harbour.l
    - Added static to forward delcaration for yyunput in order to
      match the actual definition.
  * source/compiler/harbour.y
    - Added static to forward declaration of __yy_memcpy in order
      to match the actual definition.
    - Added EXTERNAL_LINKAGE to sz_compare4 definition, so
      that the IBM C++ compiler can successfully compile Harbour.
    - Added (BYTE *) type override to szText parameter in second
      invocation of GenPCodeN (the first one already had an override).

19990507-23:15 EDT David G. Holm <dholm@jsd-llc.com>
  * source/vm/hvm.c
    - Changed byte by byte copy used in PushString to memcpy,
      because the side effects of code like szTemp[w++] = szText[w]
      is compiler dependent. Borland C++ 3.1 (in C mode) copies byte
      0 to byte 0, etc., but IBM Visual Age C++ 3.0 (in C++ mode)
      copies byte 1 to byte 0, etc.

Sat May  8 03:02:04 1999 Ryszard Glab <rglab@imid.med.pl>

    * source/compiler/harbour.y, source/compiler/harbour.l
        -static variables can be accessed in a codeblock even if this
         codeblock is a return value (detached static variables)
        -Harbour finds now illegal initializations of static variables
         (static variables can be initialized using literals only)
        -there is no 'redefinition of predefined function' error when the name
         of compiled source code is the same as reserved function
        -corrected support for /*******/ comments
        -Harbour distinguish now 'CASE' variable, 'CASE()' function and
         CASE statement (see tests/working/keywords.prg)

    * tests/working/keywords.prg
        -added many more wild statements to test Harbour compiler

    * test/working/statics.prg
        -added code to test access of static variables from a codeblock

    * source/rtl/extend.c
        -added brackets to avoid ambiguous if/else

          Fix to STOD(), added error checking to DTOS(), the later can be
          disabled to make it faster.
        * source/vm/hvm.c, include/extend.h:
          strempty() -> hb_strempty(), declaration moved to .h

        By mistake, we were not compiling the PRG files into OBJS for the
        rtl library.

        * source/rtl/dates.c:
        Changed the use of min with explicit code. min and max are macros
        in some platforms, functions in others, and it is usually a mess
        to link against them.

        * source/Makefile:
        * source/tools/Makefile:
        This directory was not being compiled.

        * source/tools/genobj.c:
        Got rid of most (all?) the warnings.

        * tests/working/Makefile:
        Now the libs to link against are explicitly specified in the
        Makefile.

        * tests/working/statics.prg:
        Cleaned up all ^M characters.

        * source/compiler/harbour.y:
        * source/rtl/set.c:
        Again, I renamed _AND and _OR to AND_ and OR_, and cleaned up a
        few warnings.

Wed May 05 18:51:06 1999  Gonzalo A. Diethelm  <Gonzalo.Diethelm@jda.cl>

        * makefile.b16:
        * makefile.b32:
        Added explicit rules to compile harbour.o from harbour.c.
        Don' know why these were necessary, but it seems people had
        problems without them.

Wed May 05 16:29:19 1999  Gonzalo A. Diethelm  <Gonzalo.Diethelm@jda.cl>

        * include/pcode.h:
        * source/vm/hvm.c:
        * source/compiler/harbour.y:
        Replaced _AND and _OR with AND_ and OR_.
        Under gcc, these two identifiers are defined out.
        Also, got rid of a few warnings.

        * source/rtl/files.c:
        Implemented a macro trick to allow compilation of
        FOPEN, FREAD and FWRITE.
        Turned off HAVE_POSIX_IO for gcc; it doesn't seem to work.
        Restructured the code so that when HAVE_POSIX_IO is not defined,
        there are no warnings.

Wed May 05 15:30:49 1999  Gonzalo A. Diethelm  <Gonzalo.Diethelm@jda.cl>

        * source/harbour.y:
        * source/compiler/harbour.c:
        Replaced main() with harbour_main(), and added a separate
        harbour.c with just the main() function.

        * makefile.b16:
        * makefile.b32:
        * makefile.vc:
        Updated these files to reflect the new source/compiler/harbour.c
        file.

        Added this file with the patterns CVS will ignore while
        processing.

        * include/Set.ch:
        * tests/working/block2.PRG:
        Added back these files. They can't be renamed through CVS on NT,
        and the repository will have to be updated by some other means.

Wed May 05 09:19:23 1999  Gonzalo A. Diethelm  <Gonzalo.Diethelm@jda.cl>

        * include/Set.ch:

        Removed these files in preparation to move them to lowercase.

        * ChangeLog:
        Added this file.

May 31, 1999 Ron Pinkas
        Harbour.l modified {Array} and added {FunArray} and {ExpArray}.
        To fix support of <INDEX> state to be recusive as well as support:
        Function()[nIndex].

        /TESTS/WORKING/ArrIndex.prg added this file.

        /TESTS/BROKEN/FuncArr.prg added this file to show:

       // This is NOT working?
       QOut( aFunc()[1]

       // But this IS working!
       a := aFunc()
       QOut( a[1] )

May 31, 1999 Ron Pinkas
        Harbour.l added support for "[String]" inside ARRAY INDEX expressions.
        Added "Sysntax error :" message for the macro operator (&)
        when followed by a string delimiter.

June 1st. 1999 00:30 Ron Pinkas
        Harbour.y -> modified pcode generation to move the push of the counter variable to the NEXT rather than the FOR
        so loop code may manipulate the counter vaiable.

        TEST/WORKING/TestFor.prg -> added this file
